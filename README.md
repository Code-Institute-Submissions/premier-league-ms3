##UX

This website has users in mind each step of the way. When firdst accessing the web page it clearly has instructions at the start on what to do, and has all clubs displayed in cards at
the bottom. also the nav helps to quickly access different clubs if they are in one club page and want to go to another. they can also click add player to create a player for a club.
The ux of the players side provides two buttons to edit and delete a player, which is usefull if the player leaves the league, or if they transfer to a different club in the premier league
and can be updated. The information has been clearly presented and a siple layout has been used to not alienate people who know nothing about football

##Features

The Edit Button when pressed directs the user to a page where they can change any of the players details, such as player position. To stop the user from going to and from pages, the 
current details of the user is already displayed, so they know what they already are. clubs are listed as a dropdown, to prevent any typo's or abbreviations of the club, which would stop
the player from appearing in the page
